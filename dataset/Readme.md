# The Yale Face Database
---

The database contains 165 GIF images of 15 subjects (subject01, 
subject02, etc.).  There are 11 images per subject, one  for each 
of the following facial expressions or configurations: center-light, 
w/glasses, happy, left-light, w/no glasses, normal, right-light, 
sad, sleepy, surprised, and wink.  Note that the image "subject04.sad" 
has been corrupted and has been substituted by "subject04.normal".

<p style="color:red"> From the 15 subjects we have chosen 10 randomly for this project. We have then chosen 1 image from each subject for testing and an additional 1 image from the discluded 5 subjects for testing. The remaining images are used for training. </p>
